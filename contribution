### Adding Language Examples

We love new language implementations! When adding a new language:

2. Include a README with setup instructions
3. Follow the same minimal principles (username + password hash only)
4. Include basic tests
5. Update the main README to reference your implementation

## Style Guidelines

- Keep it simple and minimal
- Comment your code where necessary
- Follow the language's standard conventions
- Remember: we store ONLY username and password hash

## Privacy First

Any contribution must maintain our core principle: minimal data collection. We will not accept PRs that add personal data fields to the core authentication system.

Thank you!
